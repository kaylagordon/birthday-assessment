## Turing Birthday Calendar - Frontend

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Fork + clone down this repo.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies for the repo.

Run `npm start` to start up your React server.

Run `npm run cypress` to start up the Cypress testing server.

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays the birthdays of the Turing community!

You will have 3 hours to build this application.

We do want to see good commit habits - atomic commits that log small, focused changesets. Don't worry about creating GitHub issues, though.

### Iteration 0

Pull down the [API repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/birthday-calendar-api). Set up instructions are in that repository's README.

Do *not* nest this inside your front-end repository.

### Iteration 1

Get all existing birthdays on page load and display them on the DOM, with each birthday appearing in the correct month. 

Notes:  
- For now, use the months data from the `month_data.js` file. Do not fetch that data. 
- Do not worry about including the delete button for each birthday at this point.

### Iteration 2

Create a controlled form component to create a birthday (look into the API documentation to see what pieces of information are expected, and what datatypes it wants each piece to be). As a user types into the input fields, the form component's state should change.  When the user clicks the `Add this birthday!` button, the application should update the App's state.  The new birthday should display with all of the existing birthdays. 

Notes:  
- You can assume that the user will input correct data (i.e. a number for month and day that represent a valid date). You do not need to worry about error handling!  
- Do not worry about making the POST request to the database yet.  

### Iteration 3

Now that the functionality is there for adding a birthday, write some tests:
* Write tests covering what should be displayed on the page when the user first visits.
* Write a test that checks that when data is put into the form, the value is reflected in that form input.
* Write a test to check the user flow of adding a new birthday to the page.

### Iteration 4 (extension)

When the user makes a birthday, the application should make a post request to the API. The new birthday should still exist upon reloading the page.

Note:  
- Keep any fetch calls you write in the App component for now. If you have time to refactor your fetch calls into a separate helper file, that is fine, but it is *NOT* a requirement for this application.

### Iteration 5 (extension)

Delete a birthday when the user clicks the `X` button.  The deletion should persist upon reloading the page.

### Other Extensions
* Add error handling for the form so that only valid numbers are accepted. 
* Try writing out a few other tests to cover sad path testing for your network requests.
* Use a fetch to get the month data from the API, rather than using the `months_data.js` file.
* Sort the birthdays on each Month card so they appear in chronological order.
